            Dunkan the dragon<br/><br/>

This story is about a dragon who loves to read books.
 Unfortunately, from his crazy imagination he would get so excited that he would breathe fire destroying every book he read.
  All he wanted was to get to the end of a book. He tried his best to keep his cool but it never worked. 
  Will he ever find out a way to finish a book without destroying it ?
