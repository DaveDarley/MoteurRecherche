            The sleeping beauty<br/><br/>


Once upon a time, there was a princess living in the tower, named Lala.
 She was the most beautiful one of the whole kingdom. She was cursed to sleep for a hundred years by an evil fairy; 
 she had to be awakened by a handsome prince at the end of them. The good fairy, realizing that the princess would be frightened 
 if alone when she awakens, uses her wand to put every living person and animal in the palace asleep, to awaken when the princess does.
